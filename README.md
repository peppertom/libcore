This the Stencila Core Library, a library of functions that are built in to Stencila's [Mini language](https://github.com/stencila/mini). It is to Stencila what [Excel functions](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Excel-functions-alphabetical-b3944572-255d-4efb-bb96-c6d90033e188) are to Excel, the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) is to Python, the [R Base Package](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/00Index.html) is to R, etc, etc.

Stencila functions can be implemented, and used, in a variety of languages. Mini is intentionally simple. Instead of trying to be a complete programming language, it focuses on being a "glue" between other languages. This allows functions to be implemented using the best language for the job. And when a function is implemented in multiple languages, this approach allows for the optimization of function calls based on implementation speed and data location.
