Hello! 


Stencila is an open source software project for reproducible research with the intuitive, visual interfaces that you and your colleagues are used to.

Welcome contributors to the project: Let them know that you are eager for contributions and happy that they’ve come. This is a great place to introduce yourself so people see that there’s a name and face that goes with this project.

Welcome to Stencila's Libcore repository. This repository contains the library of core fuctions that form the basis of Stencila functions and operations.  If you want to learn more about how to contribute to our core function library, you've come to the right place! The library is developed by the community. We depend on contributors (people like you!) to add new functions and point out areas for improvement. It's ok if you've never written a function or made an open source contribution before. We have resources for new function authors (link) and this document will help you make your first contribution. 

If you're interested in developing a domain specific library (eg: neuroscience), check out the libraries that are under development (link), and join our [community forum](https://community.stenci.la/) to chat about it! We want to make it easy for Stencila to do what you need it to do.
