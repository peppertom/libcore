@summary Select one or more members of a value

@description 

A general purpose function for selecting members of a compound value (e.g. array, object or table) . When the `members` parameter is an atomic value (e.g. an integer or a string) then a single member is returned. For example, `select(array, 2)` returns the second member of an array. When `members` is an array, then one or more members are returned. One-based indexing is used.

The dot operator `.` is an alias for `select` with a single string e.g `table.column1` is equaivalent to `select(table, 'column1')`.

The square brackets operator `[]` is an alias for `select` for other member selectors e.g `table[['column1', 'column2']]` is equaivalent to `select(table, ['column1', 'column2'])`.

@param {any} value The value to select values from
@param {any} members The members to select from the value
@return {any} The members of the value

@example select(array, index)
@example select(object, 'property')
@example select(table, ['column1', 'column2'])
